## It's Finally Happening

I've just officially launched a long-overdue redesign of my personal website.
My brand and personal design language has evolved so much since last year, and the fact that my website had not been caught up was concerning.

So after some long nights and 30+ Design Revisions, welcome to my new website! Here you can find various projects I've worked on, articles I've written, and more! A huge focus of mine on this project was interactivity.

You may have noticed by now that most everything is animated or has some kind of cool glow/blur effect. This is because I wanted to step slightly away from the traditional 'flat' design style, and approach something a little more... heavy, but also quick and light.
I guess that makes the website's design language sound like an oxymoron, maybe it is! A beautiful one at that in my opinion.

If you experience any bugs or random incompatibilities, suggestions or what have you... shoot me an email at [joshwcorbett@icloud.com](joshwcorbett@icloud.com)
