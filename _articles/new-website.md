I'm pleased to announce my new website! A place to connect better with my clients and audience members from Instagram.

One thing that has been the most difficult for me in this process has been deciding on a design language and a flow that I'm happy with. I recently listened to a piece from Chris Do about being too attached to projects that are in some way personal.

### Detach yourself from your projects

On this long journey to finally finish a fully functional website that I'm happy to release, I recognized a fatal flaw in my approach to this big project... I was too emotionally attached.
Because of this, I spent too much time trying to make it perfect, trying to make it scream every facet of my imagination, and every new design style I would fall in love with I would want reflected on my website. As soon as I released a visual update, I would come across more inspiration to fall in love with, and I wanted my website to reflect this. This led to countless updates and time spent away from family and friends for a meaningless visual boost. It's already up-to-date, why are we updating it again?? Because I was too involved in it.

### The Meaning of a Website

A portfolio, or any website that represents yourself or your business wasn't made just so it can be updated every time you find a new design language that you like. This leads to inconsistency, and a brand or individual that's unsure and insecure about their visual identity; when visual identity isn't the reason the website exists. The website doesn't exist to show off what design style you've rezognated with, it exists to showcase who you are and what you can do for a certain individual.

### Excuses

My excuse for performing another portfolio overhaul again, is that my last version fell short of many crucial expectations for a portfolio such as:

- content
- work to be shown
- accessibility
- well-structured biography

On this site, I have taken careful steps to tackle my shortfalls and improve as a designer and a developer. This site was made in the interest of attracting new clients and connecting with my online following, not showing off my design style.
It features a sleek, minimalistic UI that's understandable and easy to read for all individuals (including those with disabilities).

I've also taken steps to make content management more smart and automated so it can tailor the page in ways to best represent the content I'm trying to provide.

### Conclusion

When working on any project, big or small... being too attached can be a bad thing for yourself and the website you're trying to build.
Recognize the purpose of the website and build it accordingly, not to represent the brand's or individual's design choice.

I hoped you liked my first blog post ever. If you want to see more than stick around, I'm going to try writing here more because this was actually fun to write.
