When tasked with designing or developing an interface of any sort, whether that be websites, apps, etc., there will be a variety of different screen sizes that will be accessing and using these interfaces. While we're in a time where mobile devices are accessing websites just as frequently as desktop users, it's important that all elements of the site adapt to each screen size to appeal to half of the website visitors. 

Designing for mobile has become a standard that most certainly should be met, but it's also not an easy task most times.

When designing a website, our natural instinct is to create a canvas that suits larger, desktop-sized screens. Because why wouldn't we? It makes sense that we would first design for desktop... on a desktop. After the desktop design is complete, we then begin designing for smaller screens.

We've created a masterpiece for the desktop, where all of the elements are crafted in a way that makes sense to desktop users, but now when we start designing for mobile we begin to realize... that it's hard compressing content and designs from a big layout to a small one. With this approach, many times the interface becomes more complicated than it needs to be, because we're compressing a large amount of data that's displayed at once into an interface that shouldn't be showing everything at once.

Is there an alternative approach? A method that will simplify the mobile experience AND the desktop experience without even trying too hard? An approach that makes all layout make more sense and give everything some room to breathe?

Yes, and it's so easy that it's almost stupid.

Design you're mobile layouts first, and then scale that layout to your tablet and desktop sizes.
