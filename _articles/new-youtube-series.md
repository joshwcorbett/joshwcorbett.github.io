Hey folks!

As a follow up to all of the support I've recieved from my Instagram Audience, I've decided it's time to dive further into the design/development world by starting a YouTube series on [Orizon's Youtube Channel](http://https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCThOM8aCf3XRocelDMFPyVA).

I plan on making videos for intermediate/beginning designers and developers to level up their career with some awesome tips, tutorials and advice.

I don't have an exact date for when you can expect to see videos from me on the channel, but I CAN tell you that they're coming soon ;)
