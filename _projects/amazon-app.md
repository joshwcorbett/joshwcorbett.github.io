Amazon has a platform available to it's Prime users for streaming Movies, TV Shows, and more. If you can't find that one movie on Netflix or Hulu, chances are it's available on Prime Video.

I've never been a big fan of Amazon's design system, especcially on the prime video app. So I took to Adobe XD and dedicated a few hours to revamping the Prime Video experience.

My Primary Goals for this redesign:

- Improve Usability,
- Create a better design language,
- Declutter the navigation and browsing experience,

With these in mind, I went through a few revisions and landed on this.
